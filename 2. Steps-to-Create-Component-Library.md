# Create UI Component Library and use it in any of microfrontend apps. 

## Introduction

In this course, we will learn how to create a UI component library and use it in any of microfrontend apps. We will also learn how to use the library in the host app.

## Prerequisites

- You should have created the workspace with the host app and other microfrontend apps.

## Step 1: Create a UI Component Library
  ng generate library ui-component-lib

## Step 2: Create a new component in component library

This will create a new library inside your workspace, typically located at projects/ ui-component-lib.

Create Reusable Components Inside the  ui-component-lib project, you can start adding your reusable UI components. For example, let's create a button component:

```
ng generate component Button --project ui-component-lib
```

This will create a button component inside the library. You can add styles, templates, and logic to this component.

## Step 3: Export Components In the ui-component-lib.
Let's Export Components In the  ui-component-lib module. ensure that your components are exported so they can be used in other applications like the following

Create index.ts file in ui-component-lib/src/lib/ and add the following code:
```
  export * from './lib/button/button.component';
```

### Step 4: Build the ui component library.
   ng build ui-component-lib 

### Step 5: Install this built component library in the entire MFE app.
  in the root level of the MFE app, run the following command:
  npm install ./dist/ui-component-lib

### Step 6: Use the component library in any of the MFE app as per your wish.
  Example: 

  go into todos/src/app/app.component.html and add the following code:

  <div>
    <h1>My Todos</h1>
    <lib-button>Add Todo</lib-button>
  </div>

  for the above <lib-button> tag to work, you need to import the ButtonComponent from the ui-component-lib in todos/src/app/app.component.ts
  `
    import { ButtonComponent } from '../../../ui-component-lib/src'; // this line

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-todos-root',
      standalone: true,
      imports: [RouterOutlet, ButtonComponent], // this line 
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      styleUrl: './app.component.css'
    })
    `

    I used the tag as <lib-button></lib-button> because, in ui-component-lib/src/lib/button/button.component.ts, I have the selector as lib-button.

## Step 7: The same component can be used in any of the projects (users, shell) also.
