# Sharing Data Between Two Different Angular Projects in a Micro Frontend Architecture

Sharing data between two different Angular projects in a Micro Frontend architecture (such as the one you're setting up with Native Federation) typically involves using shared services, state management, or events that can communicate between the Host (Shell) and Remote (Todo) applications.

Here's how you can share data between the Shell and Todo applications:

##  Shared Service with Singleton Pattern

You can create a shared service that both the Host and Remote applications can consume. This service can be part of a shared library that both applications import. The service can be used to share data or manage application state across different modules.

### Steps:

#### 1. Create a Shared Library (just like the previously created component library)

This project will be named as shared. Inside this project we will not have any component but only service.



First, you can generate a shared library inside the workspace that both applications can use.

```
ng generate library shared
```

This will create a shared library where you can place shared services, models, or utilities.

### 2. Create a Shared Service
Inside the shared library, create a service to manage shared data.

```
ng generate service data --project shared
```

### 3. Let's use RxJS to share data
In this service, you can use RxJS subjects or BehaviorSubject to handle the shared data.

```
  // shared/src/lib/data.service.ts
  import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
  import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root', // Make sure this service is provided at the root level
  })
  export class DataService {
    private dataSource = new BehaviorSubject<any>(null);
    data$ = this.dataSource.asObservable();

    updateData(newData: any) {
      this.dataSource.next(newData);
    }
  }
  ```
The BehaviorSubject is a good choice because it can hold the current state and emit new values to any subscriber.

### Step 4: Subscribe to the shared data in any apps using RxJs
We implemented this in our previous project's Product Listing and Header component. The same way you can try. 

You can also explore the other ways to share data amon microfront end apps by searching further. 
Few other choices: 
###### 1. Window.postMessage() 

###### 2. localStorage / Session Storage
```
// shared-storage.service.ts
export class SharedStorageService {
  setItem(key: string, value: any) {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }

  getItem(key: string): any {
    return JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(key) || 'null');
  }
}
```

##### 3: Using URL Parameters or Query Strings
##### 4: Global State Management (NgRx or NGXS or Akita)
##### 5: Through Backend API by combining it with socket programming or event-driven backend.
